DEPRECATION NOTICE
This chart is DEPRECATED.

Replacement
We have built a set of fully cloud native charts in gitlab/gitlab. These new charts are designed from the ground up to be performant, flexible, scalable, and resilient.

We very strongly recommend transitioning, if you are currently using these charts. If you have never used these charts, do not now.

Availability
This project remains visible as an example of how to convert a full monolith application to Kubernetes capable. Monolith to Microservice: Pitchforks not included (video) details the work done to break this monolithic container into component parts.

GitLab-Omnibus Helm Chart
This chart is an easy way to get started with GitLab on Kubernetes. It includes everything needed to run GitLab, including: a Runner, Container Registry, automatic SSL, and an Ingress.
